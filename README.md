🐍 Python: Variables

📋 Study Checklist
• Declaration: Creating variables of different types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`).

• Naming Conventions: Applying snake case rules.

• Operations: Testing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

• Casting: Type converters using `int()`, `float()`, and `str()`.

• Interaction: Using `input()` to receive data and displaying it with `print()`.
